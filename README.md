# Word-Guessing-Game
In this project I developed a game where a user will have to guess what word is the correct answer based on the pictures given. I used different aspects of Python such as methods, conditionals and modules like tinker to create this project. I used different google images and created a user interface with buttons and labels that would allow anyone to play the game with ease.
